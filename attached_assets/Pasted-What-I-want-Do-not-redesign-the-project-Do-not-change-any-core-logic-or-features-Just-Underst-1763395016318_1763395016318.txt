What I want

Do not redesign the project.

Do not change any core logic or features.

Just:

Understand the existing codebase from the files,

Fix anything that’s broken or incomplete,

Wire everything together,

And make the bot run exactly as originally intended.

Step-by-step instructions

Scan the project

Look through all files and folders in this Repl.

Identify:

The programming language and framework (e.g. Node.js, Python, etc.).

What type of bot this is (Telegram bot, Discord bot, web/HTTP bot, etc.).

The main entry file(s) and bot logic (commands, handlers, routes).

Reconstruct the bot

Make sure all existing features from the code are preserved:

Same commands, responses, flows, events, webhooks, and background jobs.

Do not simplify or remove any important checks, conditions, or features.

If there are TODOs or obvious missing parts, implement them only to complete the original intention, not to add new features.

Dependencies & environment

Detect all required dependencies from:

package.json, requirements.txt, poetry.lock, pyproject.toml, etc.

Install anything that’s missing.

Identify all environment variables / secrets used (for example: API keys, bot tokens, DB urls).

For each env var:

Document it clearly in a comment and/or README.

Use process.env.VAR_NAME (Node) or os.getenv("VAR_NAME") (Python), etc.

Do not hardcode any secrets.

Run configuration

Set up the correct run command for Replit:

For Node: something like npm start or node index.js.

For Python: something like python main.py or the actual entry file.

Ensure the bot auto-starts when I press the Run button in Replit.

If the bot uses a web server (webhook, dashboard, etc.), bind to the correct host/port for Replit.

Bug fixes & stability

Fix any errors that prevent the bot from running:

Import/module errors

Type errors

Missing files / wrong paths

Add minimal error handling where needed without changing behavior.

If you must refactor something (e.g. to avoid crashes), keep the external behavior 100% the same.

Documentation for me

Add or update a short README.md that explains:

What this bot does.

How to run it in Replit.

What environment variables I need to set.

In your final message, tell me:

The exact command you configured for Run.

Which env vars I must fill.

Anything else I have to do (e.g. set webhooks, add bot token somewhere, etc.).

Style / constraints

Preserve:

Existing file/folder structure as much as possible.

Function names, routes, command names, and core logic.

Don’t introduce:

Extra AI features,

New frameworks,

Unnecessary redesigns.

Your job is: make the existing bot work exactly like the original using the given files.
